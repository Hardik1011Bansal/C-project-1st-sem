C Programming Major Project – <YOUR PROJECT TITLE>
📌 Project Description

This repository contains the official submission for the Programming in C (CSEG1032) major project at University of Petroleum and Energy Studies (UPES).
The project demonstrates the application of core C programming concepts including modular programming, functions, arrays, strings, structures, dynamic memory allocation, and file handling.

<Replace this section with your project idea. Example:>
This project implements a Student Record Management System, enabling users to add, update, search, and delete student records with persistent file storage. The program ensures modularity, clarity, and full compliance with evaluation guidelines.
