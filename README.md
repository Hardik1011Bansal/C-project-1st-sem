C Programming Major Project –  Random Number Guessing – Two-Player Scoring Game
Project Description

This repository contains the official submission for the Programming in C project at University of Petroleum and Energy Studies (UPES).
The project demonstrates the application of core C programming concepts including modular programming, functions, arrays, strings,conditional statements,loops.


This project is a fun point based mini game which takes user input of number and comapres it against the random number genrated by the program. Each guess is evalueted against set rules and are given apt points accordingly after each round each player is assigned some points which are added to the final score to pronounce winner.

RULES-
1. If the guessed number and the random number are same then the player is awarded 50 points
2. If the gap between random number and guessed number is greater than 0 and less than equal to 10 then 30 points are awarded
3. If the difference of random number and guessed number is in between 10 to 20 including 20 then the player gets 20 points
4. If the margin between guessed and random number lies between 20 to 30 then 10 points are awarded
5. If none of the above cases match then no points are given
